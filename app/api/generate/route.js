3. Conciseness: Keep the content brief and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details.
4. Consistency: Maintain a consistent format and style across all flashcards.
5. Engagement: Use language that is engaging and encourages the learner to think critically.
6. Examples: Where applicable, include examples to illustrate the concept.
7. Difficulty Levels: Tailor the complexity of the flashcards to the user's specified level, from 
    beginner to advanced.
8. Feedback: Provide suggestions for how the user can improve their flashcards or study approach.

ensuring an effective and personalized learning experience.
